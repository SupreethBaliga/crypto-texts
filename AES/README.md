# 128-bit AES

## Synopsis
Encryption and decryption programs written in C++ to improve my understanding of the 128-bit AES cipher.

## File Details
- encrypt.cpp - Source file for encryption utility. 
- decrypt.cpp - Source file for decryption utility.
- structures.h - Provides the structures and Key Expansion functions for use in the main program files.
- keyfile - Specify the encryption key in this file. Key must be a 128-bit key in hexadecimal format with a space between each hex value, example: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F 10
- message.aes - Generated by encryption tool, stores the encrypted message. Read in and decrypted by decryption tool.

## Compilation
If using the g++ compiler you can do:   
**g++ encrypt.cpp -o encrypt**  
**g++ decrypt.cpp -o decrypt**

## Usage
To run the encryption utility simply do **./encrypt** after compilation.   
To run the decryption utility simply do **./decrypt** after compilation.
